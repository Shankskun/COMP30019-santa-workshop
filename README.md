# santa-workshop COMP30019-2018

Game created with the unity engine, similar to the concept of "Overcooked". Elf 18 needs to keep Santa happy, and wrap every gift before Christmas :open_mouth:!
He needs to first pick up the gift item and put it in boxes; then wrap it before it reaches the Sleigh. :santa: would be Furious if he don't see the results.

Not to mention a few more surpises in the game :open_mouth:. Just watch the trailer below!
